iphoneos-ldc2 is the LDC (LLVM-based D Language) cross-compiler for
iOS.  The binaries and libraries support ARM devices (armv7,
armv7s, arm64) and the iOS Simulator.

Everything needed to rebuilt this distribution can be found at
https://github.com/smolt/ldc-iphone-dev using the tag listed by
iphoneos-ldc2 -version.  Issues can be reported there too.

Licensing - please read the included license files:

- APPLE_LICENSE applies to use of libiphoneossup.a.  If you end up
  distributing an app linked to this library, you should include a
  copy of APPLE_LICENSE file.  Source code for this library can be
  found at https://github.com/smolt/iphoneos-apple-support.
  
- COPYING.libcurl is the copyright notice for libcurl

- LICENSE is from LDC and applies to everything else

Usage of iphoneos-ldc2 is the same as ldc2 with the addition of
clang-style -arch option to select the iOS architecture to compile
code for.  Valid -arch options are armv6, armv7, armv7s, arm64,
X86_64, or i386 (armv6 is not included in the druntime/phobos
universal libs however).

Xcode or similar is needed to link and bundle an iOS app.

xc-iphoneos-dc can be used as a custom *.d build script under Xcode.
Or you can compile D source externally and add your libraries/object
files to an Xcode project.

Try this: for simple console test programs it is possible to use
environment to tell linker to use iOS sim SDK:

$ export IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=5.1
$ export SDKROOT=`xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator -show-sdk-path`
$ iphoneos-ldc2 -arch i386 hello.d -L-liphoneossup
$ ./hello
